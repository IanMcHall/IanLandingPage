        <p>The son of a publisher, I. M. Hall grew up surrounded by books and stories and developed an interest in writing at a
        young age. In high school, he began writing and editing, and would help at his mother’s business by proofing and copy
        editing jobs on commission. In 2017, he graduated from Alice Lloyd College with a Bachelor of Arts in English degree,
        and continued that education at Eastern Kentucky University, where he would go on to obtain his Master of Fine Arts in
        Creative Writing. In addition to his own writing, Hall has served as the editor for multiple novels and contributed to
        numerous literary journals, serving as Editor-in-Chief of Jelly Bucket for Reading’s 10th anniversary volume for the
        2019-2020 year.
        Hall first developed an interest in computer programming during his last semester of undergraduate study, when he took a
        programming course as an elective. Years later, in 2021, he decided to pursue programming professionally in addition to
        his artistic endeavors and began taking courses from Code: You, a program dedicated to teaching programming to Kentucky
        residents. Since beginning his tech journey, Hall has obtained certificates and built projects in languages including
        C#, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He currently works as a professional Web Developer and continues to pursue new
        skills and technologies.
