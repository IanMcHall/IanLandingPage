        The son of a publisher and a teacher, I. M. Hall grew up surrounded by books and
        stories and developed an interest in writing at a young age. In high
        school, he began writing and editing, and would help at his mother’s
        business by proofing and copy editing. In 2017, he graduated from Alice
        Lloyd College with a Bachelor of Arts in English, and continued that
        education at Eastern Kentucky University, where he would go on to obtain
        his Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing. In addition to his own
        writing, Hall has served as the editor for numerous novels, memoirs, and
        legal documents, among other works, and has contributed to multiple
        literary journals, serving as Editor-in-Chief of Jelly Bucket for
        Reading’s 10th anniversary volume for the 2019-2020 year.
        <br /><br />Hall first developed an interest in computer programming
        during his last semester of undergraduate study, when he took an elective
        computer science course. Years later, in 2021, he decided to
        pursue programming professionally in addition to his artistic endeavors
        and began taking courses from Code: You, a program dedicated to teaching
        programming to Kentucky residents. Since beginning his tech journey,
        Hall has obtained certificates and built projects in languages including
        C#, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He currently works as a
        professional Web Developer and continues to pursue new skills and
        technologies.
