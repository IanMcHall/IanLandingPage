This project is a portfolio website developed for my own projects and information. It highlights my achievements in programming and writing. This project uses an object to store and retrieve information that is displayed in my app, uses a regular expression to validate user input and inform the user about it, and retrieves data from a third-party API and uses it to display a quote within my app. The contact form is currently just a proof-of-concept for utilizing regex. Attempting to submit this form will result in an error. Please do not attempt this.
